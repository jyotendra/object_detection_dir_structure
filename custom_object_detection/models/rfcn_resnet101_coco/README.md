Various models can be found from [model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md).

The model to use should reside in it's own folder. For resnet-50, download it from [here](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/rfcn_resnet101_coco_2018_01_28.tar.gz) and unzip it inside.
